# MicroNeedle
Micro needles are widely used in the medical field. Designing a micro needle for surgery was one of the goals of the course and its design was partly described. To design the microstructure of this micro needle many properties were considered, such as Bio compatible, not brittle, no buckling and fracture in the load, no impurity in the thin layer (causing crack growth in the layer) and no covalent bonds during fabrication in the bottom layers, etc. In addition, also the ability of the needle to detect the stone and automatically and defect it after the stone has been identified. Sensing & Actuation should replace a previous micro electro mechanical structure so that the operation in this project students should use thermal actuators.
